SHORT DESCRIPTION
    BSON/JSON file collections in MongoDB

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The module works with documents stored in .bson and .json files. An empty
    file may be used to start. Use the following mudule commands:

        Open-BsonFile
        Save-BsonFile
        Close-BsonFile
        Clear-BsonFile

    Open-BsonFile creates a temporary local collection, imports the file, and
    connects the collection like Connect-Mdbc does. If the file collection is
    imported before and the file is not changed then import is skipped.

    The collection is used for quires and updates. After updates use the
    command Save-BsonFile in order to save changes to the original file.

    The collection may be kept for future work or removed by Close-BsonFile.

    Use Clear-BsonFile to remove orphan, old, or all BsonFile collections.

REQUIREMENTS
    - Local MongoDB with the default connection
    - Mdbc module https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Mdbc

TECH DETAILS
    Database: "BsonFile"
    Collections: "_index" and "<guid>" file collections

    These names should not be "known" or used directly, BsonFile commands
    operate either on file paths or their connected collection instances.
